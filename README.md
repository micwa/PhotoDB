A generically named PhotoDB application that is intended to be a frontend/GUI
for viewing and accessing a MySQL photo database.

## Overview

This project mainly consists of PhotoDB, which provides methods to retrieve
and modify rows and photos from a MySQL database, and the PhotoViewer GUI.

The GUI is designed to connect to the database; retrieve thumbnails which it
places in the sidebar to browse through; and get a specific photo from the
database when the user clicks on its corresponding thumbnail. Options are also
available for uploading and deleting photos in the database.
